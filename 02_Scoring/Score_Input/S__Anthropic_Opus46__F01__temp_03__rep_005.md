You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

## Diagnosis

There are several performance and correctness issues in the original script:

1. **Variable shadowing bug:** `filter(year == year)` inside the loop compares the column `year` to itself (because the loop variable `year` shadows the column name), returning **all rows** every iteration instead of the intended subset. This means every prediction call processes the entire dataset, massively inflating computation time and memory use.

2. **Unnecessary spatial data load:** `prep_data` is read via `st_read()` but never used in the prediction loop â€” it consumes memory for no reason.

3. **Entire dataset held as a data.frame:** `joined_data` and `pred_db` may be large data.frames. Subsetting and assigning with base R or dplyr on hundreds of thousands of rows inside a loop is slow.

4. **All libraries loaded upfront:** Several libraries (`blockCV`, `LongituRF`, `plm`, `fixest`, `spdep`, `terra`, etc.) are not needed for prediction and consume memory.

5. **No chunked or batched prediction:** `predict.randomForest` on a very large `newdata` can spike memory because it must allocate the full prediction matrix across all trees simultaneously.

6. **Output written as CSV for a potentially huge table:** `write.csv` is slow for large files; `fwrite` from `data.table` is far faster.

## Optimization Strategy

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Variable shadowing bug | Rename the loop variable (e.g., `yr`) so `filter(year == yr)` works correctly |
| Unused spatial data load | Remove `st_read()` call |
| Unnecessary libraries | Load only `randomForest`, `dplyr`, `data.table` |
| Large subset + assignment in a loop | Convert `pred_db` to `data.table` and use keyed subset-assign |
| Memory spike during `predict()` | Predict in row-chunks (e.g., 50 000 rows at a time) |
| Slow CSV write | Use `data.table::fwrite()` |

### Summary of Changes

- **Bug fix:** Renamed loop variable to `yr` so `year == yr` filters correctly, preventing full-table predictions every iteration (the single biggest performance fix).
- **Removed** the unused `st_read()` call and all unnecessary library loads, freeing significant memory.
- **Converted** to `data.table` for fast subset and assignment by reference (`:=`).
- **Added** `predict_chunked()` to break large prediction calls into 50 000-row batches, capping peak memory.
- **Replaced** `write.csv` with `fwrite` for much faster I/O.
- **Preserved** all trained Random Forest models exactly as-is â€” no retraining occurs.
