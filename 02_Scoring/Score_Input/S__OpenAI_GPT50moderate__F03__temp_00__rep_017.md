You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

 **Diagnosis**  
The main bottlenecks are:  
1. **Repeated `lapply` over 6.46M rows**: Both `build_neighbor_lookup` and `compute_neighbor_stats` iterate row-wise, creating millions of small vectors and lists. This is extremely slow and memory-heavy.  
2. **Excessive object copying**: Each `compute_and_add_neighbor_features` likely copies the entire `data.frame` repeatedly.  
3. **Inefficient neighbor lookup**: Current approach builds a large list of integer vectors for every row, which is costly in both time and memory.  
4. **Random Forest inference**: If predictions are done in a loop (row-by-row), this is catastrophic. `predict()` should be vectorized over the entire dataset or large chunks.  

---

**Optimization Strategy**  
- **Precompute neighbor relationships in a long format** (cell-year â†’ neighbor-year) and join once, instead of building a giant list.  
- **Use `data.table` for fast joins and aggregations** instead of `lapply` and `rbind`.  
- **Compute neighbor stats in bulk** using `data.table` group operations.  
- **Avoid repeated copying**: Add all neighbor features in one pass.  
- **Batch Random Forest predictions**: Use `predict(rf_model, newdata, type="response")` on the full dataset or large chunks.  
- **Memory efficiency**: Drop intermediate objects early, use integer keys, and avoid nested lists.

**Working R Code (Optimized)**  

```r
library(data.table)
library(randomForest)

# Assume: cell_data (data.frame), id_order, rook_neighbors_unique, rf_model loaded
setDT(cell_data)  # convert to data.table
setkey(cell_data, id, year)

# Expand neighbor relationships into long format
# rook_neighbors_unique: list of integer vectors (neighbors per id)
neighbor_dt <- rbindlist(lapply(seq_along(rook_neighbors_unique), function(i) {
  if (length(rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]) == 0) return(NULL)
  data.table(id = id_order[i], neighbor_id = id_order[rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]])
}))

# Cartesian join with years
years <- unique(cell_data$year)
neighbor_dt <- neighbor_dt[, .(id = rep(id, each = length(years)),
                                neighbor_id = rep(neighbor_id, each = length(years)),
                                year = rep(years, times = .N))]

# Merge neighbor values
neighbor_dt <- merge(neighbor_dt, cell_data[, .(neighbor_id = id, year, ntl, ec, pop_density, def, usd_est_n2)],
                     by = c("neighbor_id", "year"), all.x = TRUE)

# Compute neighbor stats in bulk
neighbor_stats <- neighbor_dt[, .(
  ntl_max = max(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ntl_min = min(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ntl_mean = mean(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_max = max(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_min = min(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_mean = mean(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_max = max(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_min = min(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_mean = mean(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_max = max(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_min = min(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_mean = mean(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_max = max(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_min = min(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_mean = mean(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = .(id, year)]

# Merge back to main data
cell_data <- merge(cell_data, neighbor_stats, by = c("id", "year"), all.x = TRUE)

# Random Forest prediction in bulk
# Ensure predictor columns match model
predictors <- setdiff(names(cell_data), c("id", "year", "target_var"))  # adjust target_var
predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = cell_data[, ..predictors])

# Add predictions
cell_data[, prediction := predictions]
```

**Expected Gains**  
- Eliminates millions of small `lapply` calls â†’ replaced with vectorized `data.table` operations.  
- Single merge and aggregation instead of repeated loops.  
- Random Forest predictions done in one call instead of row-wise.  
- Should reduce runtime from **86+ hours to a few hours or less**, depending on I/O and memory.  

**Key Notes**  
- Ensure `na.rm = TRUE` in aggregations; if all neighbors are `NA`, result will be `-Inf/Inf/NaN`, so handle if needed.  
- If memory is tight, process in yearly chunks or split by id blocks.  
- This preserves the trained model and original estimand.
