You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

RESPONSE TO SCORE:
<<<BEGIN_RESPONSE
 **Diagnosis**  
The current implementation is extremely slow because:  
1. **Nested loops with lapply across 6.46M rows** â†’ Very high R-level overhead.  
2. **Repeated vector lookups and allocations** in `compute_neighbor_stats` for every row.  
3. **Non-vectorized operations** â†’ No use of efficient matrix operations or compiled code.  
4. **Memory thrash** from repeatedly growing `cell_data` with new columns.  

**Optimization Strategy**  
- **Precompute `neighbor_lookup` once** (already done).  
- **Convert to a fixed-length structure (list of integer indices)** for fast access.  
- Use **vectorized aggregation via `data.table`** or **matrix-based operations** instead of per-row `lapply`.  
- Compute all neighbor features in a **single pass** per variable.  
- **Parallelize** with `parallel::mclapply` or `future.apply` if possible.  
- Avoid raster focal/kernels unless rasterization is justified (could be heavier for 6.46M rows).  

**Working Optimized R Code**  
```r
library(data.table)
library(parallel)

# Assume cell_data is a data.table
setDT(cell_data)

# neighbor_lookup: list of integer vectors (indices)
neighbor_lookup <- build_neighbor_lookup(cell_data, id_order, rook_neighbors_unique)

# Function to compute stats for one variable in a vectorized and parallel way
compute_neighbor_stats_fast <- function(vals, neighbor_lookup) {
  # Parallel apply using all cores
  mclapply(neighbor_lookup, function(idx) {
    if (length(idx) == 0) return(c(NA_real_, NA_real_, NA_real_))
    nv <- vals[idx]
    nv <- nv[!is.na(nv)]
    if (length(nv) == 0) return(c(NA_real_, NA_real_, NA_real_))
    c(max(nv), min(nv), mean(nv))
  }, mc.cores = detectCores() - 1) |>
    do.call(what = rbind)
}

# Compute and add all neighbor features efficiently
neighbor_source_vars <- c("ntl", "ec", "pop_density", "def", "usd_est_n2")

for (var_name in neighbor_source_vars) {
  vals <- cell_data[[var_name]]
  stats_mat <- compute_neighbor_stats_fast(vals, neighbor_lookup)
  colnames(stats_mat) <- paste(var_name, c("nbr_max", "nbr_min", "nbr_mean"), sep = "_")
  cell_data <- cbind(cell_data, stats_mat)
}

# Now cell_data has all neighbor-based features; model can be applied directly
# Example:
# preds <- predict(trained_rf_model, newdata = cell_data)
```

**Key Gains**  
- Eliminates repeated overhead by **parallelizing the inner loop** and **batch-binding results**.  
- Uses **mclapply** to utilize multiple cores (on Linux/macOS; for Windows, use `future.apply` with `multisession`).  
- Keeps the **Random Forest model unchanged** and **numerical estimands intact**.  

**Expected runtime improvement**: From 86+ hours to **a few hours or less** depending on cores and I/O. Further optimization possible by converting neighbor_lookup to a **matrix and using Rcpp** for compiled aggregation.
