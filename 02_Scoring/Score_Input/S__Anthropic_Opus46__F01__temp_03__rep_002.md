You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

## Diagnosis

There are several performance and correctness issues in the original script:

1. **Unnecessary library loading:** Libraries like `blockCV`, `LongituRF`, `plm`, `fixest`, `spdep`, and others are loaded but never used in the prediction loop. Each consumes memory.

2. **Loading a large spatial object unnecessarily:** `prep_data` is read via `st_read()` but never used in the prediction workflow. Spatial data with hundreds of thousands of geometries is extremely memory-intensive.

3. **Variable masking bug:** `filter(year == year)` inside the loop uses the column name `year` on both sides, which causes `dplyr` to compare the column to itself (always `TRUE`), meaning `test_set` contains **all rows** every iteration â€” massively inflating computation time and producing incorrect predictions.

4. **Monolithic `predict()` on huge data frames:** Calling `predict()` on hundreds of thousands of rows at once with a large Random Forest model can spike memory usage because the forest must route every observation through every tree simultaneously.

5. **Using a `data.frame` for row-level assignment in a loop:** Assigning into `pred_db$consolidated[pred_db$year == year]` with a standard `data.frame` is slow; `data.table` set-by-reference is far faster.

6. **Writing a potentially enormous CSV at the end:** A single `write.csv()` call on a very large frame can be slow and memory-hungry.

## Optimization Strategy

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Unused libraries & objects | Remove them to free memory |
| `prep_data` never used | Don't load it |
| Variable masking bug (`year == year`) | Rename the loop variable (e.g., `yr`) so filtering works correctly |
| Large single `predict()` call | Predict in chunks (batches) to cap peak memory |
| Slow row assignment | Convert `pred_db` to `data.table` and use set-by-reference |
| Large CSV write | Use `data.table::fwrite()` for fast, memory-efficient output |
| General | Call `gc()` between years to reclaim memory |

## Summary of Changes

- **Removed** 12 unused library calls and the unused `st_read()`, reclaiming significant RAM.
- **Fixed the critical bug:** renamed the loop iterator to `yr` so `joined_data$year == yr` filters correctly instead of returning all rows every iteration.
- **Chunked prediction:** `predict_in_chunks()` processes 50,000 rows at a time (tunable), preventing memory spikes from routing hundreds of thousands of observations through the forest simultaneously.
- **`data.table` throughout:** `set()` for O(1) by-reference column updates; `fwrite()` for fast, low-memory CSV output.
- **Explicit `gc()`** after each year to return memory to the OS promptly.
- **No models are retrained** â€” only `predict()` is called on the existing `rf_models_per_year`.
