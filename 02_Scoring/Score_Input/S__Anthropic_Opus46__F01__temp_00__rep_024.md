You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

## Diagnosis

There are several performance and correctness issues in the original script:

1. **Loading unnecessary spatial data:** `prep_data` is read via `st_read()` but never used in the prediction loop. This wastes memory, especially if the shapefile is large.

2. **Variable shadowing bug:** Inside the `for` loop, `filter(year == year)` compares the column `year` to itself (the column name shadows the loop variable), so `test_set` will always equal the entire `joined_data` dataframe rather than a single year's subset. This means every iteration predicts on the full dataset â€” massively inflating computation time and producing incorrect results.

3. **Predicting on the entire dataset at once (per iteration):** Even after fixing the bug, calling `predict()` on hundreds of thousands of rows with a large Random Forest model can spike memory usage because the model must route every row through every tree simultaneously.

4. **Using a base `data.frame` for column assignment in a loop:** Assigning into `pred_db$consolidated[pred_db$year == year]` repeatedly on a very large data.frame is slow due to repeated indexing and potential memory copying.

5. **Unnecessary libraries loaded:** Many libraries (`blockCV`, `LongituRF`, `spdep`, `plm`, `fixest`, `scales`, `stringi`, etc.) are not used in the prediction step and consume memory.

## Optimization Strategy

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Unused spatial data load | Remove the `st_read()` call |
| Unused libraries | Load only `randomForest`, `data.table`, and `dplyr` (or just `data.table`) |
| Variable shadowing bug | Rename the loop variable (e.g., `yr`) so the filter works correctly |
| Memory spike during `predict()` | Predict in chunks (batches) within each year |
| Slow data.frame assignment | Convert `pred_db` to a `data.table` and use keyed or index-based update |
| Output efficiency | Use `fwrite()` instead of `write.csv()` |

## Summary of Key Changes

- **Removed** `st_read()` and all unused library calls â†’ frees significant RAM.
- **Fixed the filter bug** by renaming the loop variable to `yr`, so `joined_data[year == yr]` correctly subsets a single year.
- **Chunked prediction** (`BATCH_SIZE`) prevents a single `predict()` call from allocating a massive matrix for all rows Ã— all trees simultaneously.
- **`data.table`** replaces base `data.frame` for fast subsetting and in-place column updates (no deep copies).
- **`gc()`** after each year reclaims memory promptly.
- **`fwrite()`** replaces `write.csv()` for much faster file output.

No models are retrained; only the prediction loop is restructured.
