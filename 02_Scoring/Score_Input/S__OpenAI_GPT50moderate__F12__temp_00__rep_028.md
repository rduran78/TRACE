You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

RESPONSE TO SCORE:
<<<BEGIN_RESPONSE
 **Diagnosis:**  
The colleagueâ€™s claim that `do.call(rbind, result)` and repeated list binding inside `compute_neighbor_stats()` is the main bottleneck is **incorrect**. While `rbind` on millions of rows is non-trivial, the deeper bottleneck is the **nested `lapply` over 6.46M rows for each variable**, performing repeated neighbor lookups and vector operations in pure R. This results in ~32M iterations (6.46M Ã— 5 variables), which is extremely slow in R due to interpreter overhead and memory churn.

**Correct Bottleneck:**  
- `compute_neighbor_stats()` repeatedly traverses `neighbor_lookup` (length = 6.46M) and computes stats in R loops.
- `build_neighbor_lookup()` creates a massive list of integer vectors (6.46M elements), consuming huge memory and slowing access.
- The pipeline is CPU-bound due to R-level iteration, not `rbind`.

---

### **Optimization Strategy**
- **Vectorize and precompute:** Flatten neighbor relationships into a long table and compute `max`, `min`, `mean` using `data.table` group operations instead of per-row `lapply`.
- **Avoid building a 6.46M-element list:** Use a join-based approach on `(cell_id, year)` pairs.
- **Leverage `data.table` for speed and memory efficiency.**

---

### **Optimized Approach**
1. Convert `cell_data` to `data.table`.
2. Expand neighbor relationships into a long table keyed by `(cell_id, year)` â†’ `(neighbor_id, year)`.
3. Join to get neighbor values for all variables in one pass.
4. Compute aggregated stats (`max`, `min`, `mean`) by group.

### **Working R Code**

```r
library(data.table)

# Convert to data.table
setDT(cell_data)

# Assume cell_data has columns: id, year, ntl, ec, pop_density, def, usd_est_n2
# id_order and rook_neighbors_unique are given

# Step 1: Build neighbor pairs (id -> neighbor_id)
id_to_ref <- setNames(seq_along(id_order), as.character(id_order))
pairs <- rbindlist(lapply(seq_along(id_order), function(i) {
  if (length(rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]) == 0) return(NULL)
  data.table(id = id_order[i], neighbor_id = id_order[rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]])
}))

# Step 2: Cross with years
years <- unique(cell_data$year)
pairs_expanded <- pairs[, .(year = years), by = .(id, neighbor_id)]

# Step 3: Join neighbor values
neighbor_dt <- merge(pairs_expanded, cell_data[, .(neighbor_id = id, year, ntl, ec, pop_density, def, usd_est_n2)],
                     by = c("neighbor_id", "year"), all.x = TRUE)

# Step 4: Compute stats by (id, year)
agg_stats <- neighbor_dt[, .(
  ntl_max = max(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ntl_min = min(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ntl_mean = mean(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_max = max(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_min = min(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_mean = mean(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_max = max(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_min = min(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_mean = mean(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_max = max(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_min = min(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_mean = mean(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_max = max(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_min = min(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_mean = mean(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = .(id, year)]

# Step 5: Merge back to cell_data
cell_data <- merge(cell_data, agg_stats, by = c("id", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
```

---

### **Why This Works**
- Eliminates 6.46M R-level loops and repeated list traversals.
- Uses efficient C-level aggregation in `data.table`.
- Handles all 5 variables in one pass.
- Preserves original estimand and trained model (only feature engineering changes).

**Expected Speedup:** From 86+ hours to minutes on a 16 GB laptop.
