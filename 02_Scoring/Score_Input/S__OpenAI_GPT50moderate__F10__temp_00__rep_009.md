You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

 **Diagnosis**  
The current implementation is extremely slow (86+ hours) because:  
- It repeatedly computes neighbor statistics for each variable and each row using `lapply` over 6.46M rows.  
- Neighbor lookups are recomputed for every variable.  
- No vectorization; heavy R-level loops and repeated memory allocations.  
- Graph topology is rebuilt per call instead of once.  

**Optimization Strategy**  
- Build the neighbor index once and reuse it.  
- Use a sparse adjacency matrix representation for the rook graph.  
- Compute neighbor aggregates (max, min, mean) via efficient matrix operations instead of per-row loops.  
- Process all years in a single pass by grouping or by block processing to fit memory.  
- Avoid repeated `rbind` and `lapply`; use `data.table` or `Matrix` for speed.  
- Preserve numerical equivalence by applying the same aggregation logic.

### **Efficient R Implementation**

```r
library(data.table)
library(Matrix)

# Assume: cell_data has columns id, year, ntl, ec, pop_density, def, usd_est_n2
# id_order: vector of unique cell IDs in consistent order
# rook_neighbors_unique: spdep::nb object

# Convert to data.table for speed
setDT(cell_data)

# Build adjacency matrix once (sparse)
n_cells <- length(id_order)
adj_list <- rook_neighbors_unique
rows <- rep(seq_along(adj_list), lengths(adj_list))
cols <- unlist(adj_list)
adj <- sparseMatrix(i = rows, j = cols, x = 1, dims = c(n_cells, n_cells))

# Map id to row index
id_to_idx <- setNames(seq_along(id_order), id_order)

# Add index column for fast join
cell_data[, idx := id_to_idx[as.character(id)]]

# Variables to process
vars <- c("ntl", "ec", "pop_density", "def", "usd_est_n2")

# Prepare result containers
for (v in vars) {
  cell_data[, paste0(v, "_nbr_max") := NA_real_]
  cell_data[, paste0(v, "_nbr_min") := NA_real_]
  cell_data[, paste0(v, "_nbr_mean") := NA_real_]
}

# Process year by year to limit memory
years <- sort(unique(cell_data$year))

for (yr in years) {
  sub <- cell_data[year == yr]
  idxs <- sub$idx
  
  for (v in vars) {
    vals <- sub[[v]]
    
    # Create vector of values aligned to id_order
    vec <- rep(NA_real_, n_cells)
    vec[idxs] <- vals
    
    # Compute neighbor values using adjacency
    # For mean: sum and count
    sum_vals <- adj %*% vec
    count_vals <- adj %*% (!is.na(vec))
    
    # For max and min: need custom aggregation
    # Extract neighbor indices for each node
    nbr_idx <- adj_list
    max_vals <- numeric(length(idxs))
    min_vals <- numeric(length(idxs))
    
    for (i in seq_along(idxs)) {
      nbrs <- nbr_idx[[idxs[i]]]
      if (length(nbrs) == 0) {
        max_vals[i] <- NA
        min_vals[i] <- NA
      } else {
        nbr_vals <- vec[nbrs]
        nbr_vals <- nbr_vals[!is.na(nbr_vals)]
        if (length(nbr_vals) == 0) {
          max_vals[i] <- NA
          min_vals[i] <- NA
        } else {
          max_vals[i] <- max(nbr_vals)
          min_vals[i] <- min(nbr_vals)
        }
      }
    }
    
    mean_vals <- (sum_vals[idxs] / count_vals[idxs])
    
    # Assign back
    cell_data[year == yr, paste0(v, "_nbr_max") := max_vals]
    cell_data[year == yr, paste0(v, "_nbr_min") := min_vals]
    cell_data[year == yr, paste0(v, "_nbr_mean") := mean_vals]
  }
}

# At this point, cell_data has neighbor features added
# Apply pre-trained Random Forest model
# Example: predictions <- predict(rf_model, newdata = cell_data)

### **Why This is Efficient**
- Adjacency matrix built once and reused.  
- Year-wise processing avoids loading all 6.46M rows into memory at once.  
- Mean computed via sparse matrix multiplication (fast).  
- Max/min computed in a single loop per year (much smaller than original nested loops).  
- Avoids repeated `rbind` and `lapply`.  

**Expected Speedup:** From 86+ hours to a few hours or less on a 16 GB laptop, depending on I/O and loop optimizations.  

**Numerical Equivalence:** Preserved because aggregation logic (max, min, mean of neighbors) is unchanged.
