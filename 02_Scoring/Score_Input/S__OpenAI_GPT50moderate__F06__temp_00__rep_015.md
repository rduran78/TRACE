You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

 **Diagnosis**  
The current implementation is extremely slow because:  
- It uses `lapply` over ~6.46M rows, repeatedly subsetting vectors and creating intermediate objects.  
- Neighbor lookups are recomputed for each row, causing heavy R-level overhead.  
- No vectorization or efficient data.table/dplyr operations are used.  
- Memory pressure is high due to repeated list allocations.  

**Optimization Strategy**  
- Precompute neighbor indices once (already done via `neighbor_lookup`).  
- Use `data.table` for fast grouping and joins.  
- Reshape data to long format and compute neighbor stats via keyed joins instead of per-row loops.  
- Compute all neighbor stats in a single pass per variable.  
- Avoid repeated `paste` and string operations inside loops.  

**Working R Code** (optimized approach using `data.table`):  

```r
library(data.table)

# Assume: cell_data (data.frame), id_order, rook_neighbors_unique, neighbor_source_vars defined
# Convert to data.table
setDT(cell_data)

# Precompute neighbor pairs (cell_id -> neighbor_id)
id_to_ref <- setNames(seq_along(id_order), as.character(id_order))
neighbor_pairs <- rbindlist(lapply(seq_along(id_order), function(i) {
  if (length(rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]) == 0) return(NULL)
  data.table(
    id = id_order[i],
    neighbor_id = id_order[rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]]
  )
}))

# Expand neighbor pairs across all years
years <- unique(cell_data$year)
neighbor_pairs <- neighbor_pairs[, .(id = rep(id, length(years)),
                                     neighbor_id = rep(neighbor_id, length(years)),
                                     year = rep(years, each = .N))]

# Key tables for fast join
setkey(cell_data, id, year)
setkey(neighbor_pairs, neighbor_id, year)

# For each variable, compute neighbor stats
for (var_name in neighbor_source_vars) {
  # Join neighbor values
  neighbor_vals <- neighbor_pairs[cell_data, on = .(neighbor_id = id, year), nomatch = 0]
  setnames(neighbor_vals, var_name, "neighbor_val")
  
  # Compute stats by (id, year)
  stats <- neighbor_vals[, .(
    max_val = max(neighbor_val, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_val = min(neighbor_val, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_val = mean(neighbor_val, na.rm = TRUE)
  ), by = .(id, year)]
  
  # Merge back to cell_data
  setkey(stats, id, year)
  cell_data <- stats[cell_data]
  
  # Rename columns
  setnames(cell_data, c("max_val", "min_val", "mean_val"),
           paste0(var_name, c("_nbr_max", "_nbr_min", "_nbr_mean")))
}

# cell_data now has neighbor features added
```

**Why this works:**  
- Eliminates per-row loops; uses vectorized joins and aggregations.  
- Handles all years and neighbors in bulk.  
- Scales to millions of rows efficiently on 16 GB RAM.  
- Preserves original estimand and Random Forest model (no retraining).  

**Expected runtime:**  
From 86+ hours â†’ likely under 1 hour on a standard laptop, depending on disk I/O and CPU.
