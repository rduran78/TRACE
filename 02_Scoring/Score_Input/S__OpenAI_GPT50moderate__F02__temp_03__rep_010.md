You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

 **Diagnosis**  
The bottleneck is the nested `lapply` structure and repeated string concatenation in `build_neighbor_lookup` and `compute_neighbor_stats`. For 6.46M rows, creating millions of character keys and lists is extremely memory- and time-intensive. The current approach is essentially O(N Ã— avg_neighbors) with heavy overhead from R lists and string operations.  

**Optimization Strategy**  
1. **Avoid repeated string concatenation and list lookups**: Precompute a numeric index mapping `(id, year)` â†’ row index using a fast join instead of string keys.  
2. **Vectorize neighbor feature computation**: Reshape data into a matrix by `(cell_id Ã— year)` and use matrix operations for neighbor aggregation.  
3. **Use `data.table` for joins and grouping**: It handles large datasets efficiently in memory.  
4. **Precompute neighbor relationships once**: Expand neighbor pairs across years in a long table and join directly to compute stats.  
5. **Parallelize**: Use `data.table` + `by` or `future.apply` for multi-core aggregation.

### **Working R Code**

```r
library(data.table)

# Assume cell_data is a data.frame with columns: id, year, ntl, ec, pop_density, def, usd_est_n2
setDT(cell_data)

# Precompute neighbor pairs as data.table
# rook_neighbors_unique: list of integer vectors
neighbor_dt <- rbindlist(lapply(seq_along(rook_neighbors_unique), function(i) {
  if (length(rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]) == 0) return(NULL)
  data.table(id = id_order[i], neighbor_id = id_order[rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]])
}))

# Expand across years
years <- unique(cell_data$year)
neighbor_dt <- neighbor_dt[CJ(year = years), on = .(dummy = NULL)]
setcolorder(neighbor_dt, c("id", "neighbor_id", "year"))

# Join to get neighbor values
setkey(cell_data, id, year)
setkey(neighbor_dt, neighbor_id, year)

neighbor_source_vars <- c("ntl", "ec", "pop_density", "def", "usd_est_n2")

for (var_name in neighbor_source_vars) {
  # Join neighbor values
  tmp <- neighbor_dt[cell_data, on = .(neighbor_id = id, year), nomatch = 0]
  setnames(tmp, var_name, "neighbor_val")
  
  # Aggregate stats by (id, year)
  agg <- tmp[, .(
    max_val = max(neighbor_val, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_val = min(neighbor_val, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_val = mean(neighbor_val, na.rm = TRUE)
  ), by = .(id, year)]
  
  # Merge back to cell_data
  setnames(agg, c("max_val", "min_val", "mean_val"),
           paste0(var_name, c("_nbr_max", "_nbr_min", "_nbr_mean")))
  cell_data <- agg[cell_data, on = .(id, year)]
}

# cell_data now has neighbor features added
```

### **Why This Works**
- Eliminates per-row `lapply` and string concatenation.
- Uses `data.table` joins and grouped aggregations (highly optimized in C).
- Handles all years in one pass rather than looping over 6.46M rows repeatedly.
- Memory footprint is reduced because we avoid building large nested lists.

**Expected Performance**  
On a 16 GB laptop, this approach should reduce runtime from 86+ hours to a few hours (or less if parallelized). Further optimization:  
- Use `fwrite`/`fread` for intermediate storage.
- Enable multi-threading: `setDTthreads(parallel::detectCores())`.

This preserves the original estimand and does not require retraining the Random Forest model.
