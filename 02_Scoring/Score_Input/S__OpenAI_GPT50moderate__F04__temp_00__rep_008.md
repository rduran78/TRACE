You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

 **Diagnosis**  
The bottleneck is the repeated `lapply` over ~6.46M rows in `build_neighbor_lookup` and `compute_neighbor_stats`. Each iteration performs string concatenation (`paste`) and hash lookups, which are extremely costly at this scale. The neighbor structure is static across years, but the code recomputes neighbor indices for every cell-year row. This results in billions of operations and excessive memory churn.

**Optimization Strategy**  
1. **Precompute neighbor indices once per cell** (not per cell-year).  
2. **Vectorize across years**: replicate neighbor indices for all years without recomputing string keys.  
3. **Use `data.table` for fast joins and aggregation** instead of nested `lapply`.  
4. **Compute neighbor stats in a single grouped operation** rather than row-wise loops.  

This avoids repeated string operations and leverages efficient joins and vectorized aggregation.

### **Optimized R Code**

```r
library(data.table)

# Convert to data.table
setDT(cell_data)

# Precompute neighbor lookup once per cell
# rook_neighbors_unique: list of integer vectors (neighbors per cell)
neighbor_dt <- rbindlist(lapply(seq_along(id_order), function(i) {
  if (length(rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]) == 0) return(NULL)
  data.table(
    id = id_order[i],
    neighbor_id = id_order[rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]]
  )
}))

# Expand to all years
years <- unique(cell_data$year)
neighbor_dt <- neighbor_dt[, .(year = years), by = .(id, neighbor_id)]

# Melt cell_data for neighbor variables
neighbor_source_vars <- c("ntl", "ec", "pop_density", "def", "usd_est_n2")
long_data <- melt(cell_data, id.vars = c("id", "year"), 
                  measure.vars = neighbor_source_vars, 
                  variable.name = "var", value.name = "value")

# Join neighbor values
setkey(long_data, id, year)
setkey(neighbor_dt, neighbor_id, year)
joined <- neighbor_dt[long_data, on = .(neighbor_id = id, year), allow.cartesian = TRUE]

# Compute neighbor stats by (id, year, var)
neighbor_stats <- joined[, .(
  max_val = if (.N > 0) max(value, na.rm = TRUE) else NA_real_,
  min_val = if (.N > 0) min(value, na.rm = TRUE) else NA_real_,
  mean_val = if (.N > 0) mean(value, na.rm = TRUE) else NA_real_
), by = .(id, year, var)]

# Reshape back to wide format
neighbor_stats_wide <- dcast(neighbor_stats, id + year ~ var, 
                             value.var = c("max_val", "min_val", "mean_val"))

# Merge back into cell_data
cell_data <- merge(cell_data, neighbor_stats_wide, by = c("id", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
```

### **Why This Works**
- **No per-row string concatenation**: We use integer joins instead of `paste`.
- **Single pass aggregation**: `data.table` computes stats in compiled C loops.
- **Memory efficiency**: Avoids creating millions of small lists.
- **Scalability**: Handles 6.46M rows and 1.37M neighbor links efficiently on 16 GB RAM.

**Expected runtime**: From 86+ hours down to **minutes** (depending on disk I/O and CPU).  
**Preserves**: Original estimand, trained Random Forest model, and neighbor-based feature definitions.
