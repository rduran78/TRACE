You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

RESPONSE TO SCORE:

 **Diagnosis:**  
The bottleneck is the loop-based prediction over large datasets (`hundreds of thousands of cells per year`) combined with `dplyr` filtering and repeated indexing. This approach is memory-inefficient and slow because:
- `filter()` and subsetting inside the loop repeatedly copy large data frames.
- Predictions are done year by year instead of in a vectorized or batched manner.
- `pred_db$consolidated[...] <- ...` triggers repeated writes to a large object.

**Optimization Strategy:**  
- Use `data.table` for fast filtering and assignment (avoids repeated copies).
- Pre-split data by year once, or use `data.table` grouping.
- Predict in chunks if memory is limited (batch processing).
- Avoid growing objects inside the loop.
- Keep models as is (no retraining).

### **Optimized R Code**

```r
library(data.table)

# Convert to data.table for efficiency
setDT(pred_db)
setDT(joined_data)

# Ensure 'year' is the same type in both
pred_db[, year := as.character(year)]
joined_data[, year := as.character(year)]

# Initialize consolidated column
pred_db[, consolidated := NA_real_]

# Process by year using data.table grouping
for (yr in names(rf_models_per_year)) {
  cat("Predicting for year", yr, "\n")
  
  rf_model <- rf_models_per_year[[yr]]
  
  # Subset joined_data for this year
  test_set <- joined_data[year == yr]
  
  if (nrow(test_set) > 0) {
    # Predict in chunks to avoid memory overload
    chunk_size <- 50000
    preds <- numeric(nrow(test_set))
    
    for (i in seq(1, nrow(test_set), by = chunk_size)) {
      idx <- i:min(i + chunk_size - 1, nrow(test_set))
      preds[idx] <- predict(rf_model, newdata = test_set[idx])
    }
    
    # Assign predictions back to pred_db efficiently
    pred_db[year == yr, consolidated := preds]
  } else {
    cat("Warning: No data for year", yr, "\n")
  }
}

# Write output
fwrite(pred_db, "RF_imputated_db.csv")
```

**Why this works:**  
- `data.table` avoids repeated copies and speeds up filtering/assignment.
- Chunked prediction prevents memory overload.
- Preserves trained models and original logic.
- Scales better for hundreds of thousands of rows.

**Extra tip:** If `joined_data` and `pred_db` share a unique ID, merge predictions back by ID instead of relying on row order for robustness.
