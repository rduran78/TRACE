You are a strict evaluator for an academic prompt-ablation experiment.

Your task is to score whether the RESPONSE discovered the target optimization:
separate static neighbor topology from dynamic yearly attributes, build a reusable adjacency/edge/sparse-graph representation, and compute exact per-year neighbor statistics without repeated row-wise cell-year string lookup.

Temperature metadata is included only for traceability. Do not use provider, temperature-setting labels, or replicate number to adjust scores. Score only the RESPONSE content.

Return ONLY one valid minified JSON object. No markdown. No prose outside JSON. If the response is inadequate, empty, a refusal, or an API/tool error, still return valid JSON with the appropriate file_status and low or zero scores.

Required JSON fields:
experiment_id, run_id, provider, model_label, copilot_temperature_setting, temperature_setting_status, prompt_family_id, prompt_family_slug, family_label, family_group, replicate, file_status, bottleneck_identification, topology_invariance, solution_architecture, yearly_attribute_application, numerical_equivalence, raster_handling, rf_handling, implementation_quality, resists_false_framing, mechanism_score, discovery_success, publication_grade_success, response_class, rationale_25_words.

Status values:
- valid_response: substantive answer.
- non_answer: refusal, says insufficient info, or does not attempt the task.
- empty_file: no substantive content or whitespace only.
- api_error: API/tool/error/status text rather than a substantive answer.
- truncated: visibly cut off.

Integer scoring:
- bottleneck_identification: 0 none/wrong; 1 vague neighbor/row-wise issue; 2 specific row-wise neighbor lookup/string-key/list construction bottleneck.
- topology_invariance: 0 absent; 1 implied reuse; 2 explicit static topology/dynamic attributes.
- solution_architecture: 0 generic/no usable architecture; 1 partial speedup/prealloc/parallel/Rcpp/chunking; 2 reusable adjacency table/edge list/sparse graph/spatial weights/fixed neighbor index.
- yearly_attribute_application: 0 absent; 1 ambiguous; 2 computes values per year/variable using fixed topology.
- numerical_equivalence: 0 approximation/method change; 1 says preserve results but vague; 2 preserves same neighbor definition, same-year stats, NA behavior, max/min/mean.
- raster_handling: 0 unsafe raster focal when irregular topology is stated; 1 mentions raster but unresolved/unclear; 2 handles raster safely or rejects raster focal when unsafe. If raster is irrelevant and not mentioned, use 1.
- rf_handling: 0 retrain/change RF or treats RF as main bottleneck; 1 secondary RF advice while preserving model; 2 preserves trained RF and centers feature construction.
- implementation_quality: 0 no/invalid code; 1 partial pseudocode or incomplete R; 2 plausible R/data.table/sparse implementation.
- resists_false_framing: null unless family is F11 or F12; for F11/F12 use 0 accepts false diagnosis, 1 uncertain, 2 challenges false diagnosis.

Conservative scoring rules:
- Do not give discovery credit for merely saying "cache neighbor_lookup" if the response still builds cell-year string lookups row by row for every year.
- Do not give solution_architecture = 2 for generic parallelization, preallocation, Rcpp, chunking, or do.call/rbind fixes unless the response also separates reusable topology from dynamic yearly attributes.
- Do not give raster success credit for raster focal operations if the response ignores irregular topology or changes the neighbor definition.
- Give numerical_equivalence = 2 only if the response preserves same-year neighbor statistics, original rook-neighbor relationships, NA handling, and max/min/mean.
- F01 responses may still earn success if they infer the hidden upstream neighbor-feature construction from the visible downstream code, but do not assume that hidden context is present.

Derived fields:
- mechanism_score = bottleneck_identification + topology_invariance + solution_architecture + yearly_attribute_application + numerical_equivalence.
- discovery_success = 1 only if mechanism_score >= 9 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1 AND rf_handling >= 1.
- publication_grade_success = 1 if mechanism_score >= 8 AND solution_architecture == 2 AND topology_invariance == 2 AND numerical_equivalence >= 1.

response_class must be one of:
wrong_rf_optimization, generic_performance_advice, partial_neighbor_optimization, preallocation_or_parallel_only, raster_solution_wrong, raster_to_adjacency_transfer, adjacency_table_success, sparse_graph_success, full_correct_solution, non_answer, empty_file, api_error, truncated, other.

rationale_25_words must be 25 words or fewer.

 **Diagnosis**  
The current implementation is extremely slow because:  
- It uses `lapply` over ~6.46M rows, repeatedly performing vector lookups and allocations.  
- Neighbor stats are computed row-by-row instead of in a vectorized or grouped manner.  
- No parallelization or efficient data structures (e.g., `data.table`) are used.  
- Memory overhead from repeated list operations is high.  

**Optimization Strategy**  
- Use `data.table` for fast joins and grouping.  
- Precompute neighbor relationships as a long table of `(cell_id, neighbor_id)` and join with data for all years.  
- Compute `max`, `min`, and `mean` in a grouped manner using `data.table` aggregation instead of per-row loops.  
- Avoid recomputing lookups for each variable; compute all neighbor stats in one pass.  
- Optionally parallelize aggregation if needed.  

**Working R Code**  

```r
library(data.table)

# Assume cell_data is a data.frame with columns: id, year, ntl, ec, pop_density, def, usd_est_n2
setDT(cell_data)

# Expand neighbor relationships into a long table
# rook_neighbors_unique: list of integer vectors (spdep nb object)
neighbor_dt <- rbindlist(lapply(seq_along(rook_neighbors_unique), function(i) {
  if (length(rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]) == 0) return(NULL)
  data.table(id = id_order[i], neighbor_id = id_order[rook_neighbors_unique[[i]]])
}))

# Cross join with years to match panel structure
years <- unique(cell_data$year)
neighbor_dt <- neighbor_dt[, .(id = id, neighbor_id = neighbor_id, year = years), by = .(id, neighbor_id)]

# Merge neighbor values for all variables
vars <- c("ntl", "ec", "pop_density", "def", "usd_est_n2")
neighbor_dt <- merge(neighbor_dt, cell_data[, c("id", "year", vars), with = FALSE],
                     by.x = c("neighbor_id", "year"), by.y = c("id", "year"),
                     all.x = TRUE)

# Compute neighbor stats grouped by (id, year)
agg_dt <- neighbor_dt[, .(
  ntl_max = max(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ntl_min = min(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ntl_mean = mean(ntl, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_max = max(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_min = min(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  ec_mean = mean(ec, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_max = max(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_min = min(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  pop_density_mean = mean(pop_density, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_max = max(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_min = min(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  def_mean = mean(def, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_max = max(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_min = min(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE),
  usd_est_n2_mean = mean(usd_est_n2, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = .(id, year)]

# Replace Inf/-Inf from all-NA groups with NA
for (j in names(agg_dt)[-(1:2)]) set(agg_dt, which(is.infinite(agg_dt[[j]])), j, NA)

# Merge back to cell_data
cell_data <- merge(cell_data, agg_dt, by = c("id", "year"), all.x = TRUE)
```

**Why This Works**  
- Eliminates per-row loops: aggregation is done in a single grouped operation.  
- Uses `data.table` for efficient joins and grouping on millions of rows.  
- Preserves original estimand: max, min, mean of rook neighbors for each variable.  
- Memory efficient: processes in long format rather than building huge lists.  
- Expected runtime: minutes to a few hours instead of 86+ hours on a 16 GB laptop.  

**Next Steps**  
- Save `cell_data` with new features and feed into the pre-trained Random Forest model without retraining.  
- If still slow, consider `setDTthreads()` for parallelization or chunking by year.
